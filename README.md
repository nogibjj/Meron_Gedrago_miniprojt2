# Meron_Gedrago_miniproject1

Welcome to the second mini project for Data Engineering!

## Context for this project 

This project aims to build on top of the first week's mini project where we built the following. 

* *README.md*: this is the document that you are reading right now that explains the purpose of the project and any important information to the reader or whoever wants to replicate the project 
* *requirements.txt*: list of packages that the project uses/"requires" (as the name suggests) with the version numbers 
* *MG_main.py*: a simple multiplication function that inputs two numbers and multiplies them!
* *Test_MG_main.py*: a series of cases that test whether or not my MG_main code works correctly 
* *Makefile*: series of useful commands that we want to run when we call it such as installing the required packages from the requirements document, formatting the code, running our test and other commands we would want to automate 
* *.devcontainer*: this enables the setting up of a virtual environment that will allow the code to work on any computer and not just on the one that it was created on. This file contains the devcontainer and Dockerfile, which are long templatized codes and are changed slightly across projects
* *CI/CD or hello.yml*: a set of instructions or automated actions that we want to be executed after a certain action e.g., when the code is pushed to github or pulled  

## Data and purpose of this project

I looked into the death rates per 100,000 people in the United States over the years. As we can observe, the rate has been increasing with a small decrease in 2017.
